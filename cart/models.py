from django.db import models

# Create your models here.    





# In a Django model, the Command Pattern might not be implemented explicitly in the same way as in a general Python application. However, you can structure your Django models and views in a way that follows similar principles. 
# Django itself uses an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, 
# and you can leverage this architecture to create a separation of concerns similar to the Command Pattern.
